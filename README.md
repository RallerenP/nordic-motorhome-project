# Nordic Motorhome Project

## Case Description
Nordic Motorhome Rental is a Danish company that rents out motorhomes. Nordic Motorhome Rental was founded in 2019 and is situated just outside Copenhagen. So far there are 8 employees, but the company is very successful, and the two owners expect to hire more people in the near future.

**Employees:** 4 sales assistants, 2 cleaning staff, 1 auto mechanic, 1 bookkeeper

### The Fleet
Nordic Motorhome Rental has a fleet of 32 motorhomes available for hire. Nordic Motorhome Rental currently offers 8 different types of motorhomes. These are of various brands and models. Some are small compact campers for 2 persons and others are large with up to 6 beds.

### Prices per day
The price per day for rent depends on the brand and model of the motorhome. Apart from the brand and model price per day also depends upon the season. There are 3 seasons: Peak season, Middle Season and Low season.

In peak season the prices for all motorhomes are 60 % higher than prices in the low season. In middle season the prices for all motorhomes are 30 % higher than prices in the low season.

The price per day includes:

* 400 free kilometers per day.
* Insurance
* External cleaning

### Pick-up and drop-off points
Nordic motorhome rental offers delivery of motorhomes to a location that is most convenient for the customers. It is often an airport, but it can be any other location for instance a ferry port or a hotel. For pick-up or drop-off outside Nordic motorhome Rentals office, customers will be charged a transfer cost of 0,70€ per kilometer.

### Extras
To make the trip more enjoyable customers can rent accessories such as bike rack, bed linen, child seat, picnic table and chairs etc.

### Service and repairs
After drop-off the Motorhome will be cleaned. The auto mechanic checks oil & water etc. If repairs or further service is needed the auto mechanic register this.

# Your task
You are hired to develop a new system for Nordic Motorhome Rental that can handle information about motorhomes, rentals and customers.
